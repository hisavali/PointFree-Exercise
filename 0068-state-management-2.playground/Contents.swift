 Explore ways in which we can transform reducers that work on sub-state into

 To get your feet wet, start by trying to implement the following function to

 6. Can you generalize the solution to the previous exercise to work for any generic LocalValue and GlobalValue instead of being specific to Int and AppState? And can you generalize the action to a single shared Action among global and local state?

 Hint: this solution requires you to both extract a local value from a global one to send it through the reducer, and take the updated local value and set it on the global one. Swift provides an excellent way of handling this: writable key paths!
